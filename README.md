# PythonWebScraper

This is a project I created to demonstrate my Python skills. In this instance, this script mostly uses BeautifulSoup to parse through the received HTML and use a for loop to parse it into variables, then later on print them out using the f-string format to print out the E-Commerce site's product information.

This project demonstrates data procurement and the art of story telling with data.
